Purpose
=======
The purpose of this document is to identify issues and configuration
requirements with Telit's modems.

HE910
=====

GPS:
  To enable location reporting on the Telit HE910 the modem needs to be
  switched to Port Configuration #8. Please refer to Telit's
  'HE910 UE910 Family Ports Arrangements' section 4.1.3 for rationale and
  'AT Commands Reference Guide' section 3.5.7.1.96 for specific AT command.
  After setting the configuration, a power cycle is required.
  Port Configiuration #8 is available since firmware 12.00.004. Firmware version
  can be checked using 'AT+CGMR'.

LE910 V2
========

Default USB composition of LE910V2 uses PID 0x36 (AT#PORTCFG=0)
and consists of 6 serial ports (CDC-ACM standard, /dev/ttyACMx)
and 1 network adapter using CDC-NCM standard (wwanx or usbx).

NCM interface configuration follows Telit documentation
(both documents available on Telit Download Zone - registration required)
"GE/HE/UE910, UL865, LE910 V2 Linux USB Driver - User Guide r0"
(document 1VV0301255 Rev.0 - 2016-01-22)
and "Telit LE910-V2 NCM SETUP r3"
(document 1VV0301246 Rev.3 - 2016-11-29).

After context is setup, NCM mode activated and PDP context activated
connection configuration can be read using
AT+CGPADDR=context_id and AT+CGCONTRDP=context_id commands.
This is done automatically and results available via
org.ofono.ConnectionContext.GetProperties DBus method.

Then Linux network interface needs to be configured:
    ifconfig <Interface> <Address> netmask <Netmask> up
    route add default gw <Gateway>
    arp -s <Gateway> 11:22:33:44:55:66

Only after these steps network interface is usable.
